### Adding project_name to your build

Easiest way to start with project_name is to add Maven dependencies into your Maven project.
project_name's Maven group ID is `org.jfoma.project_name` and its artifact ID is `project_name`.

Optional "flavors" description.

To add a dependency on project_name, use the following:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.jfoma.project_name</groupId>
  <artifactId>project_name</artifactId>
  <version>?</version>
</dependency>
```

To add a dependency using Gradle:

```

  compile 'org.jfoma.project_name:project_name:?jre'
}
```
